# Software Requirements Third Edition

* The book is a practical guide to software requirements. You don't need to read it completely to start using this knowledge.

* At the end of each chapter, a section named 'Next Steps' is provided. I recommend that if you have less time, then just directly go to this section of the topic you are interested in and dive deeper into text only if needed.
