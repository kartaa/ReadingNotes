# Reading Notes and Bookmarks

I have collated the notes and bookmarks from my book reads here. The notes have been made from the perspective of a Computer engineer. So, search or go through these notes to quickly find things of your use in the books that I have read.

The notes are organized in chapters one for each book read. The individual notes are organized as an ordered list. Since, this book is searchable you can quickly make a keyword search or just go through the notes.

Disclaimer: These notes are not much usable without the books. However, I  encourage you to try using them, if all you need is a quick summary of the book.



### Before further reading
These notes are not exhaustive, although are quite opinionated. As you know, when $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are
$$x = {-c \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
***These notes are my solution and there could also be an other solution.***
